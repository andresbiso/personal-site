üëâüèª If your company or organization would like to add new points of view on how to solve problems, let me be part of that change.

üéì Since I was a kid, I have always been interested in computers and the way they work. My passion for programming started when I found a program that let me create my own video games. That experience ignited the spark which, later on, led me on becoming a software developer.

üìä I consider myself a proficient Software Developer with over 9 years of experience.
I embarked on my professional journey through an internship program in 2015. Since then, I‚Äôve remained an integral part of a vibrant community of professionals committed to software quality, good development practices, and continuous learning.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve had the privilege of collaborating with both national and international clients, including:

- An American Multinational Tobacco Company.
- One of the Top Private Universities in Argentina.
- One of the Oldest American Investment Management Firms based in Boston.
- A Fortune 500 Multinational Investment Bank and Financial Services Company based in New York City.

My expertise primarily lies in the .NET platform and the Angular application framework. However, I‚Äôve also worked with clients who leverage the Java and React ecosystems.

I pride myself on being proactive. I consistently stay informed about the latest advancements in the software industry, exploring how these novel approaches can be seamlessly integrated into the projects I‚Äôm involved in. I always maintain an open mindset to welcome new concepts and feedback, which has allowed me to enhance both my interpersonal and technical abilities.
