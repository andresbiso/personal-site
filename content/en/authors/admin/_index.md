🎓 Since I was a kid, I have always been interested in computers and the way they work. My passion for programming started when I found a program that let me create my own video games. That experience ignited the spark that made me decide to choose the orientation in Computing and Digital Media during high school. After that I enrolled on the Information Systems Engineering career which, later on, led me on becoming a software developer.\
\
📊 During my time as a developer, I have worked on a wide range of projects for different companies. I find working as a developer fun and challenging. From working on these projects, I demonstrated strong abilities programming in Angular and .NET. I was also able to improve my communication skills in english being, nowadays, able of explaining technical issues in a fluent way.
