üó∫ I hold dual citizenship for both Argentina (South America) and Portugal (Southern Europe).

üëâüèª If your company or organization would like to add new points of view on how to solve problems, let me be part of that change.

üéì Since I was a kid, I have always been interested in computers and the way they work. My passion for programming started when I found a program that let me create my own video games. That experience ignited the spark that made me decide to choose the orientation in Computing and Digital Media during high school. After that I enrolled on the Information Systems Engineering career (I am currently studying a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science) which, later on, led me on becoming a software developer.

üìä During my time as a full-stack software developer, I have worked on a wide range of projects for different companies. I find working as a developer fun and challenging. From working on these projects, I have demonstrated strong abilities programming in multiple technologies like, for example, .NET, Angular, Java and ReactsJs. I was also able to improve my communication skills in english being, nowadays, able of explaining technical issues in a fluent way.
